Collaboration diagrams are used to show how objects
interact to perform the behavior of a particular use case, or a 
part of a use case. Along with sequence diagrams, 
collaborations are used by designers to define and clarify the 
roles of the objects that perform a particular flow of events 
of a use case. They are the primary source of information 
used to determining class responsibilities and interfaces.

Unlike a sequence diagram, a collaboration diagram shows 
the relationships among the objects. Sequence diagrams and 
collaboration diagrams express similar information, but show 
it in different ways. Collaboration diagrams show the 
relationships among objects and are better for understanding 
all the effects on a given object and for procedural design.
