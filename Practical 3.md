An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is a visual representation of the data model for a 
database system. ER diagrams are widely used in database design and modeling to depict the 
structure of a database, including the entities (objects or concepts), their attributes) (properties), 
and the relationships between them. The key elements and concepts in an ER diagram:

1. Entity: An entity is a real-world object, concept, or thing that has a distinct existence 
and can be uniquely identified. In an ER diagram, entities are represented as rectangles. 
Each entity is typically labeled with its name, and it can have various attributes

2. Attributes: Attributes are properties or characteristics that describe entities. Attributes 
are depicted as ovals connected to their respective entities. Each attribute has a name and 
a data type that specifies the kind of data it can hold (e.g., integer, string, date).

3. Relationship: A relationship represents an association between two or more entities.
It describes how entities are related to each other. Relationships are depicted as diamond 
shapes connecting the participating entities. Each relationship has a name that describes 
the nature of the association.

4. Cardinality: Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be 
associated with the instances of another entity through a relationship.
